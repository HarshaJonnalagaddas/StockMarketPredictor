# Stock Market Prediction using RNNs and FinBERT - Jonnalagadda Sri Harsha

## üîç Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of deep learning models for stock market prediction. It includes:

- Exploratory data analysis and traditional forecasting methods.
- Implementation and **comparative analysis** of RNN-based models: **RNN**, **LSTM**, **GRU**, and **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**.
- A hybrid **BiLSTM + FinBERT** architecture integrating sentiment analysis from real-time financial news headlines.

## üß† Background

### ‚è± Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs process sequential data, making them ideal for time-series tasks such as stock prediction. However, they struggle with long-term dependencies.

### üí° LSTM and GRU
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** introduces memory gates to capture long-range dependencies effectively.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** is a simplified version of LSTM with similar performance but fewer parameters.

### üîÅ Bidirectional LSTM
Processes sequences in both forward and backward directions, capturing a richer context.

### üì∞ FinBERT for Sentiment
[FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) is a pre-trained NLP model tuned on financial texts. It helps capture **sentiment polarity** from recent news headlines, integrated into stock price predictions.

## üìä Comparative Model Insights

Run `compare.py` to visualize and compare the performance of:

- ‚úÖ RNN
- ‚úÖ LSTM
- ‚úÖ GRU
- ‚úÖ BiLSTM

Each model is trained on the same dataset and their predictions are plotted side by side for evaluation.

## üß† FinBERT + BiLSTM Hybrid (fibertLSTM.py)

This advanced script:
- Fetches the latest stock prices (2019‚Äì2025).
- Gathers recent news headlines using `StockNews` RSS.
- Applies FinBERT sentiment scoring to each headline.
- Integrates sentiment with BiLSTM predictions using a linear combination.
- Visualizes:
  - BiLSTM-only predictions
  - BiLSTM + FinBERT-enhanced predictions
